        <h1>Interests and Hobbies</h1>
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <div class="text">
        <p>I really like music, especially Hasidic music, but also classical music.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My favorite musical instrument is the piano and I have my own electric piano.</p>

        <h2>Chess</h2>
        <p>In my spare time I enjoy playing chess.
            <br>
            Playing by myself mostly against others online, and even watching games to learn new methods.
            <br>
            In school I was the champion, and I participated in the city championship and once even in the national team championship (as a substitute).</p>
        </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
        <p>My main area of interest is historiography, mainly the history of the Jewish people in recent generations: the Holocaust, the establishment of the state and its wars.
Favorite ways of learning history:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia</li>
<li>YouTube</li>
<li>Documentary programs of the Israeli television</li>
</ul>
        <h2>Sport</h2>
<p>I am a sports fan from time to time - mainly in big competitions like the Olympics and the World Cup,
    <br>
    as well as in international tournaments where Israeli athletes participate in basketball, judo, swimming and more.
